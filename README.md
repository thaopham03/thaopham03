### CompSci & Math @ Berea College 2026

## ✨ About me:
- I research the risks and robustness of large language models (LLMs), focusing on deceptive alignment and evaluation benchmarks. Currently, I'm deepening my understanding of AI safety and x-risk through the AISF Alignment course by BlueDot Impact, as I believe AI safety is the most critical challenge of our time.
- As a passionate OSS contributor, my previous OSS contribution includes BIMserver and Runestone Academy. Besides, I am always looking for opportunities to become a community builder, especially around accessible AI safety education for the Global South.
- Outside of work, I am a Rubik’s Cube and Weiqi enthusiast. Sometimes, you'll find me hiking the mountains in the Appalachia or the mesmerizing valley of Andorra.
