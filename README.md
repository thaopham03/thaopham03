### CompSci & Math @ Berea College 2026

## ✨ About me:
- Exploring my research interests in AI Safety: Can LLMs reason? What are some emergent capabilities of LLMs that are not fully measured? Will LLMs be capable of doing automation research? 
- Other interests: robust evaluation benchmarks, threat modeling, learning mech interp. 
- A mountain lover. Practicing rationality.
