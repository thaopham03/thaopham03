## âœ¨ About me:
- I am interested in opportunities to learn more about AI Safety/Alignment. One of my research projects at Vanderbilt focused on mitigating biases in language models' cognition through counterfactual prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning. I want to further this research on the cognitive processes of language modelsâ€”how they "think" and respond to prompts. I am open to suggestions for my research questions/proposals. 
- I am also interested in evals. I am still very new to evals and want to get to know more perspectives on this research area. Open to projects/research related to evals.
- I also worked as an OSS developer for a [BIM(Building Project Management)-server project](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/), maintaining and expanding the database for storing and managing IFC files. I have been a frequent contributor to the OS community for about a year and a half now, continuing from my first OS contribution - [Runestone Academy](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive).
